# My TypeScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my TypeScript learning repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains my personal notes, exercises, and small projects that Iâ€™m working on as I learn TypeScript. The goal of this repository is to document my progress and share my learning process with others. As I continue to explore and grow in TypeScript, Iâ€™ll update this repository with new insights and code snippets.

## About `basics.ts`

The `basics.ts` file is where I am documenting all the fundamental concepts of TypeScript. Itâ€™s a simple starting point where Iâ€™ve written down different aspects of TypeScript that I learn, ranging from basic syntax to more advanced features.

The main goal of this file is:

- To solidify my understanding of TypeScriptâ€™s syntax and features.
- To keep a record of useful tips and tricks.
- To experiment with new features and improvements in TypeScript.
